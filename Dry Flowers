Pay your pennies through the person on the road,
As he turns to the greys(?) of your blood souls (or soles?)
He cuts fresh flowers and blesses sacred ground,
And sheds good fortune and spreads it all around,
He's sympathetic to your cause, to have worldly wealth no more,
Paying pennies and paying none(?) and I'm sure it'll be more than enough.

And the frown on your face is telling, and it's telling me you`re not ready for this world,
And its telling me I'm not steady on my feet again.

Cut the roses,
Prick your fingers,
Taste the blood.

Dry flowers, at my door, dry flowers, from my lover from before.

Pour the posion in your brothers cup tonight,
So when he sips he will never wake his eyes.
Mercy killing. That's so heavy on the heart,
But it's better, than this world`s crumbling parts.

And the frown on your face is telling, and It's telling me you`re not ready for this world,
And It's telling me I'm not steady on my feet again.

Cut the roses,
Prick your fingers,
Taste the blood.

Dry flowers, at my door, dry flowers, from my lover from before,
Dry flowers, at my door, dry flowers, but he`s not there anymore.


The other rose is red where you are
(?)I`ll divide us blue and yellow(?)
Do you really ween on the moon?
Is it really hollering your thought(?)

Dry flowers, at my door, dry flowers from my lover from before,
Dry flowers, at my door, dry flowers, but he`s not there anymore.
